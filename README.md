# Realistic 3D Graphics Engine

**Project Duration:** Sep. 2023 -- Dec. 2023  
**Technologies Used:** C++ with SDL2

This project is a 3D Rendering and Animation Engine designed to render realistic 3D graphics.

## Features

- **OBJ Geometry File Loading:** Load and render 3D models from OBJ files.
- **OBJ Material File Loading:** Load materials associated with OBJ files.
    
- **Wireframe 3D Scene Rendering:** Render 3D scenes in a wireframe mode.
- **Flat Colour 3D Scene Rasterising:** Render 3D scenes with flat colors.
- **Keyboard Control of Camera Orientation:** Control the camera's orientation using a matrix for rotation.

- **Surface Texture Mapping:** Apply textures to surfaces for more detailed rendering.
- **Hard Shadow Rendering:** Render shadows with hard edges (without soft shadows).
- **Soft Shadow Rendering:** - Smooth and elegant soft shadows.
- **Ambient Lighting:** Implement ambient lighting as a minimum threshold or universal light supplement.
- **Diffuse Lighting:** Calculate and render light based on proximity and angle of incidence.
- **Specular Lighting:** - Visible specular highlights (specular spots).

- **Reflective Materials:** Implement materials like mirrors and metals that reflect light.

- **Gouraud Shading:** Smooth shading technique to interpolate vertex colors.
- **Phong Shading:** Implement Phong shading for smoother lighting and shading.
